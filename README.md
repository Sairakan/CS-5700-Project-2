Proper documentation should accompany your project. A 3-line README file will be unacceptable. Make sure to put your name+NUID (for each member) inside the README. Make sure to explain at least 2 scenarios that you tested (e.g. gave bad input as one of the arguments, used specific network configuration, etc).
